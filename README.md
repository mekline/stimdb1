# Stimdb1

This is intended to be a working mockup of the stimulus database; it will hopefully soon have a small set of contributors, movies, etc.; and we'll work on connecting the currently coded movies up with the firebase.app backend.

See stimdb1.firebaseapp.com for the currently deployed version...
