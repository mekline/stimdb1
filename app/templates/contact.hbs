<p>Thank you for checking out the NAMEOFDATABASE! This is a mockup of the stimulus database; it's designed to have a relatively small number of stimulus sets and creators in order to test out feature implementation. Currently it's the only instantiation of the database.</p>

<p>The plan for the project is to focus initially on event stimuli, and then branch out to other classes. We're not yet ready to upload new sets, but we are very interested in hearing from you if you are interested in contributing stimuli! If you are interested or have any other questions about the project, please send a message below. Your email will be added to a list to be contacted about updates!</p>
